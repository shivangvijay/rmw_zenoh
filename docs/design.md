# Design

## Introduction

`rmw_zenoh_cpp` maps the ROS 2 [RMW API](https://github.com/ros2/rmw/tree/rolling/rmw/include/rmw) as of late 2023 onto Zenoh APIs, using [zenoh-c](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh-c).
The end result is that users can use ROS 2 to send and receive data over Zenoh, using the APIs that they are already familiar with.

## Brief overview

There is more detail on each item below, but a brief overview on how this is accomplished is the following:

* It is assumed that a Zenoh router is running on the local system.  This router will be used for discovery and host-to-host communication.  However it is *not* used for intra-host comms (i.e., as a message broker); that is done via direct peer-to-peer connections.
* Each "context" in ROS 2 is mapped to a single Zenoh "session".  That means that there may be many publishers, subscriptions, services, and clients sharing the same session.
* Every "context" has a local "graph cache" that keeps track of the details of the network graph of ROS 2 entities.
* Zenoh publishers, subscriptions, services, and clients are created or destroyed when the corresponding RMW APIs are called.
* Data is sent and received through the appropriate zenoh-c API when the corresponding RMW APIs are called.

The following diagram shows the default network topology of a subsystem composed of 3 nodes:

| Mode | Peer   | Router   |
| Connect | tcp/localhost:7447   |  -  |
| UDP Multicast | Disabled | Disabled   |
| Gossip Scouting | Enabled | Enabled   |

## Router

Zenoh has the ability to do discovery using local multicast announcements.
However, local multicast has some limitations, both intrinsic and specific to Zenoh:

* Multicast discovery can cause a lot of discovery traffic while discovering all other entities in the graph.
* Multicast discovery has a limited TTL (time-to-live), which means it can usually only discover peers on the local network segment.

To alleviate issues with multicast discovery, `rmw_zenoh_cpp` relies on a Zenoh router to discover peers and forward this discovery information to other peers via Zenoh's `gossip scouting` functionality.
Hence `rmw_zenoh_cpp` requires the Zenoh router to be running.

It should be noted that when building upstream Zenoh from source, a `zenohd` binary is created which is the router.
`rmw_zenoh_cpp` has its own simplified version of the router that nonetheless uses most of the same code.
This was done so that Zenoh didn't have to be vendored twice (once for zenoh-c and once for zenohd), and so that the router could be more easily integrated into the ROS 2 package format.

As of 2024-02-09, the user is expected to launch the router by hand.
In order to integrate more seamlessly into ROS 2, the Zenoh router can be launched by running `ros2 run rmw_zenoh_cpp rmw_zenohd`.
The default configuration that the router uses is located in [DEFAULT_RMW_ZENOH_ROUTER_CONFIG.json5](../rmw_zenoh_cpp/config/DEFAULT_RMW_ZENOH_ROUTER_CONFIG.json5).
The user can use a custom configuration by setting the `ZENOH_ROUTER_CONFIG_URI` environment variable to point to a valid [Zenoh configuration file](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh/blob/main/DEFAULT_CONFIG.json5).

In the future, additional work may be done to automatically launch a Zenoh router if one isn't already running.

## Serialization/Deserialization

By default, Zenoh doesn't specify a serialization format; it just delivers bags of bytes.
There are quite a few serialization formats that `rmw_zenoh_cpp` could use, including protobuf, CDR, Cap'n Proto, JSON, etc.
In the current design, `rmw_zenoh_cpp` uses CDR as the serialization format for the following reasons:

* Using CDR means that data can be bridged between Zenoh and DDS without a deserialization/serialization step.
* Using CDR means that a new typesupport doesn't have to be developed, which is its own project.

## Graph Cache

One of the biggest impedance mismatches between Zenoh and ROS 2 has to do with graph introspection.
Zenoh attempts to do the absolute minimum of discovery (for performance reasons), while ROS 2 generally assumes that the entire graph is available from all entities in the system (for debugging/introspection reasons).
To deal with this discrepancy, each context in `rmw_zenoh_cpp` keeps a cache of all entities discovered in the graph so far.
An "entity" is a node, publisher, subscription, service server, or service client.
Each entity sends a unique liveliness token as it comes online, and removes that liveliness token when it is destroyed.
The key expression of these liveliness tokens encode information about the entity and it's relationship to the other entities in the system (for instance, a publisher is always attached to a node within a certain namespace).
The format of a liveliness token is:

`<ADMIN_SPACE>/<domainid>/<id>/<entity>/<namespace>/<nodename>`

Where:

*  `<domainid>` - A number set by the user to "partition" graphs.  Roughly equivalent to the domain ID in DDS.
*  `<id>` - A unique ID to identify this entity. Currently the id is the zenoh session's id with elements concatenated into a string using '.' as separator.
*  `<entity>` - The type of entity.  This can be one of "NN" for a node, "MP" for a publisher, "MS" for a subscription, "SS" for a service server, or "SC" for a service client.
*  `<namespace>` - The ROS namespace for this entity.
*  `<nodename>` - The ROS node name for this entity.

During context initialization, `rmw_zenoh_cpp` calls `zc_liveliness_get` to get an initial view of the entire graph from other nodes in the system.
From then on, when entities enter and leave the system, `rmw_zenoh_cpp` will get new liveliness tokens that it can use to update its internal cache.

## Contexts

A ROS 2 context describes a certain middleware configuration, which can contain 0 or more ROS 2 nodes.
In `rmw_zenoh_cpp`, a context maps to a Zenoh session, along with a liveliness token for the graph cache and some additional metadata.

Zenoh allows sessions to be custom configured through a configuration file.
If otherwise unconfigured, `rmw_zenoh_cpp` uses a [default configuration file](../rmw_zenoh_cpp/config/DEFAULT_RMW_ZENOH_SESSION_CONFIG.json5).
The user can use a custom configuration by setting the `ZENOH_SESSION_CONFIG_URI` environment variable to point to a valid [Zenoh configuration file](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh/blob/main/DEFAULT_CONFIG.json5).

## Namespaces

ROS 2 has a concept of "namespaces", where everything under that namespace has an additional prefix added to all names.
Because of this, namespaces are not separate "entities" in a ROS 2 graph.

Zenoh doesn't directly have a concept of a namespace; instead, everything is under a single global namespace, but can be partitioned by using `/` in topic and queryable names.

To map the ROS 2 concept of namespaces onto Zenoh, all entity liveliness tokens encode the namespace.
Since Zenoh liveliness tokens cannot be empty, in the case of an empty namespace (the default), a namespace of `%` is used.

## Nodes

A ROS 2 node can be though of as the "unit of computation" in a ROS 2 graph; usually one node performs one particular task.
Nodes may contain publishers, subscriptions, service servers, service clients, action servers, action clients, parameters, and anything else needed to do some computation.
Zenoh has no conceptual equivalent to the ROS 2 node, so `rmw_zenoh_cpp` creates no Zenoh entities when nodes are created.

When a new node is created through the RMW API, a liveliness token of type `NN` is sent out.

## Publishers

A ROS 2 publisher sends data to 0 or more connected subscriptions.
A Zenoh publisher does exactly the same thing, so ROS 2 publishers are mapped onto Zenoh publishers in `rmw_zenoh_cpp`.
If the Quality of Service durability for a publisher is `TRANSIENT_LOCAL`, a Zenoh publication cache will also be created with `ze_declare_publication_cache`.
See the [Quality of Service](#Quality-of-Service) section below for more information.

When a new publisher is created, a liveliness token of type `MP` is sent out.

## Subscriptions

A ROS 2 subscription receives data from 1 or more connected publishers.
A Zenoh subscriber does exactly the same thing, so ROS 2 subscriptions are mapped onto Zenoh subscribers in `rmw_zenoh_cpp`.
If the Quality of Service durability for a subscription is `TRANSIENT_LOCAL`, a Zenoh `ze_owned_querying_subscriber_t` will be created; in all other cases, a `z_owned_subscriber_t` will be created.
See the [Quality of Service](#Quality-of-Service) section below for more information.
When new data arrives, a callback within `rmw_zenoh_cpp` is executed, which takes ownership of the data and signals that there is data available.
Then rmw_wait can find out that there is data available, and the data can be delivered via rmw_take.

When a new subscription is created, a liveliness token of type `MS` is sent out.

## Service Clients

In ROS 2, services are meant to be used for remote procedure calls that will return fairly quickly.
`rmw_zenoh_cpp` uses Zenoh queryables to implement ROS 2 services.
When a client wants to make a request, it uses the rmw API `rmw_send_request`.
Attached to that request are various other pieces of metadata, like the sequence number of the request and the GUID of the client that sent the request.
The sequence number is used to correlate this request to the response that comes back later.
`rmw_zenoh_cpp` then calls the Zenoh `z_get` function to send a query out to the network.

Assuming there is a service server listening to that queryable, it will receive the request, perform a computation, and return the result.
The result will then be made available to the client via `rmw_take_response`.

When a new service client is created, a liveliness token of type `SC` is sent out.

## Service Servers

In ROS 2, services are meant to be used for remote procedure calls that will return fairly quickly.
`rmw_zenoh_cpp` uses Zenoh queryables to implement ROS 2 services.
When a ROS 2 node wants to advertise a service to the network, it calls `rmw_create_service`.
`rmw_zenoh_cpp` uses the `z_declare_queryable` Zenoh API to create that service.
When a client request comes in, `rmw_take_request` is called to send the query to the user callback, which should perform some computation.
Once the user callback returns, `rmw_send_response` is called to send the response back to the requester.

When a new service server is created, a liveliness token of type `SS` is sent out.

## Quality of Service

The ROS 2 RMW layer defines quite a few Quality of Service settings that are largely derived from DDS.
Here is an incomplete list of some of the settings and the values that they can take:

* RELIABILITY
    * RELIABLE - Applicable only for subscriptions.  Data delivery is retried until it is successfully delivered.
    * BEST_EFFORT - Data may be dropped during delivery. Because Zenoh is TCP-based (by default), this may not work exactly the same as in DDS.  This is the `SYSTEM_DEFAULT` reliability.
* HISTORY
    * KEEP_LAST - For subscriptions, only keep up to a maximum number of samples (defined by depth); once the maximum is reached, older samples will be lost.  This is the `SYSTEM_DEFAULT` history.
    * KEEP_ALL - For subscriptions, keep all values.
* DEPTH - The maximum number of samples to keep; only comes into play when KEEP_LAST history is used.  If `DEPTH` is set to 0, `rmw_zenoh_cpp` will choose a depth of 42.
* DURABILITY
    * VOLATILE - Samples will only be delivered to subscriptions that are active at the time of publishing.  In `rmw_zenoh_cpp`, this is implemented via `z_declare_subscriber` on the subscription side and `z_declare_publisher` on the publisher side.  This is the `SYSTEM_DEFAULT` durability.
    * TRANSIENT_LOCAL - "Late-joining" subscriptions will receive historical data, along with any new data.  In `rmw_zenoh_cpp`, this is implemented via `ze_declare_querying_subscriber` on the subscription side and `ze_declare_publication_cache` on the publisher side.
* LIVELINESS
    * AUTOMATIC - The "liveliness" of an entity of the system is managed by the RMW layer.  This is the only LIVELINESS that `rmw_zenoh_cpp` supports.
    * MANUAL_BY_TOPIC - It is up to the application to periodically publish to a particular topic to assert liveliness.
* DEADLINE - The period at which messages are expected to be sent/received.  Currently unimplemented in `rmw_zenoh_cpp`.
* LIFESPAN - The age at which messages are expired and no longer valid.  Currently unimplemented in `rmw_zenoh_cpp`.

In Zenoh, there are essentially no "incompatible" Quality of Service settings.
This means that any publisher can match any subscriber.

## Events

A ROS 2 RMW may communicate information not directly concerned with communication by using "events".
For instance, if a message is lost, then the RMW layer may raise an event to the upper layers to signal that fact.

Events are broken down into subscription events and publisher events:

* Subscription
    * LIVELINESS_CHANGED
    * DEADLINE_MISSED
    * QOS_INCOMPATIBLE
    * MESSAGE_LOST
    * INCOMPATIBLE_TYPE
    * MATCHED
* Publisher

## Actions

As of 2024-02-09, there is no concept of an action at the RMW level in ROS 2.
Instead, actions are composed of several services and pub/sub.
Thus, there is no direct implementation of actions in `rmw_zenoh_cpp`.

## Security
